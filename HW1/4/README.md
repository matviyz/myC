##### Input
`scanf` is used to take 3 string inputs and copy them onto 3 character arrays: `a[]`,`b[]`,`c[]`.
##### Sorting
The first character of each string is copied onto the first 3 values of the sorting array, `sort[]`.
Using a basic sorting algorithm, `sort[]` is made alphabetical.
##### Output
For 3 inputs, there are a max of 6 different possibilites of ordering the strings.
For each possibility there's a matching `if` statement that then prints out the strings in alphabetical order.
