##### Input
`scanf` grabs the input in minutes and sets it to `in`, which is then also set to `min`.\
('in' and 'min' are both required in order to display the input AND output at the end)
##### Calculation
A `for` loop is initialized and runs until `min` is less than 60.\
For every iteration the loop subtracts 60 from `min` and increments `hr`.
##### Output
The input, `in`, and outputs, `hr` and `min`, get printed.
