#####Input
A decimal is input into `float` `in`.
#####Calculation
The input is first converted into an integer by being mutiplied by 100.\
This is done so the arithmetic will have less problems.\
A loop is run for each type of coin until the remaining input is less than the coin value.\
For each iteration, the value of the coin is subtracted and the `int` of the coin is incremented.
#####Output
The resulting values of each coin variable are printed.
